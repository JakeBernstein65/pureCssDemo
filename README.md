# Art Through History with Pure.CSS  

pureCssDemo is a basic application that demonstrates the simplicity and effectiveness of [Pure.CSS](http://purecss.io/) with RhoMobile.  

This Web App Shows famous pieces of art with descriptions and context for the pieces. With the help of Pure, this web app adapts to the size of your screen, meaning that you can shrink and stretch your screen, and the art pieces will keep their proportions so you that you can view the images in the best format, no matter where you are or what device/screen size you are using.  

Pure is only 4kb when zipped and is very mobile friendly.  

In the repository, both a finished version of the demo and a starter version of the demo are included.  

**Demo Files**  
The only files we will are adding in our RhoMobile project are:  

* index.html  
* css/main.css  
* js/main.jss  

Some of the photos are from Wikimedia.org and require you to have wifi connected and to use a device, computer, or iOS simulator to view them.
